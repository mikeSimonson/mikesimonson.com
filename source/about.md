# About the Author or Blog


Whoever bumps into Mike discovers quickly that he is an enthusiastic - talkative - and open-minded guy.

Even if the computer science has always been part of his life, Mike really considered turning this passion into a full-time activity when turning 20.

Knowledge-addict and true believer of the open-source movement, he is more and more involved in the PHP community participating to conferences and meeting inspiring people.
He created the Brussels PHP user group and is now the maintainer of doctrine/migrations.
All things that motivates him to contribute back even more.

See you at the social!
