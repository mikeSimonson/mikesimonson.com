<!--
                        Note: The date should be formatted exactly as it's shown below. In particular, the
                        "least significant" characters of the month should be encapsulated in a <span>
                        element to denote what gets dropped in 1200px mode (eg. the "uary" in "January").
                        Oh, and if you don't need a date for a particular page or post you can simply delete
                        the entire "date" element.

                    -->
<span class="date">
    <span class="month">{{ page.date|date('F')|slice(0,3) }}<span>{{ page.date|date('F')|slice(3) }}</span></span>
    <span class="day">{{ page.date|date('j') }}</span>
    <span class="year"><span class="year-separator">, </span>{{ page.date|date('Y') }}</span>
</span>
